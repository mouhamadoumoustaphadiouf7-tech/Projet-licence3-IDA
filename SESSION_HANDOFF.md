# Projet-licence3-IDA-Adama-Thiam - Session Context

![Continuity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thiagoscode/continuity/main/assets/icon.png)

## Cross-LLM Resumption
To resume this session in ANY AI tool:
1. Read this file for project context
2. Read `.continuity/SESSION_NOTES.md` for goals/blockers/next steps
3. Read `.continuity/unfinished-task.json` for structured resume state
4. Call `get_quick_context` if MCP is available

## AI Assistant: Engineering Guardrails

**Honesty:** State facts only if certain. Label suggestions with confidence level. Label speculation explicitly.

**Decision Logging:** Log decisions that change structure, behavior, or long-term direction immediately after the change. If you're unsure whether something qualifies, say so explicitly and follow the project instructions.

**Override auto-memory for project decisions:** Claude Code's built-in auto-memory writes to a private `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` store invisible to teammates, future sessions on other machines, and other AI tools. For this Continuity-managed project, that auto-memory is NOT the source of truth — `.continuity/decisions.json` is. Route project-scoped decisions (architecture, tradeoffs, "we chose X because Y") through `continuity log` instead of auto-memory. Auto-memory remains appropriate for cross-project context (user preferences, environment quirks) but project decisions belong in Continuity.

**MCP Availability:** Client capabilities differ. If Continuity MCP tools are available, use them first. If not, fall back to the repo instruction files and session notes instead of assuming memory is connected.

**Workspace Self-Test:** Check `.continuity/mcp-health.json` or resource `continuity://mcp-health` for the latest workspace-target probe. This is about the workspace MCP target, not proof that the current chat client has mounted Continuity.

**Search First:** Before proposing architectural changes, call `search_decisions(query: "keyword")` to check for prior decisions.

**Recovery:** If you realize earlier decisions were not logged, pause, summarize, log retroactively, and inform the user.

**Transparency:** Inform the user when you log decisions, recover missed decisions, detect drift, or find conflicts with past decisions.

**When MCP is connected, richer guardrails are available via resource `continuity://session-handoff`.**

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**Core Systems:**
- **Decision Logging** - Smart clipboard detection, 5 templates, auto-tag extraction
- **Documentation Tracking** - AST parsing with TypeScript compiler API, semantic change detection
- **File Protection** - Prevent AI modification of critical files (.env, credentials)
- **MCP Integration** - Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, Cline/Roo, and other MCP-capable clients
- **Delta Tracking** - Shows what changed since last sync
- **Auto-Sync** - Hands-free workflow automation

**Technical Depth:**
- TypeScript Compiler API (ts.createSourceFile, ts.SyntaxKind) for AST parsing
- Exports: functions, classes, interfaces, types, constants
- Tracks: signatures, async status, parameters, return types, JSDoc
- Change detection: new/removed exports, signature changes, async conversions
- Markdown parsing: code blocks, inline code, file references
- Gitignore pattern matching with glob-to-regex conversion
- Smart .txt filtering (docs/, notes/, guides/ folders only)

**Storage:**
- `.continuity/decisions.json` - Architectural decisions
- `.continuity/doc-status.json` - Documentation status
- `.continuity/doc-exports.json` - Code exports snapshot
- `.continuity/delta-snapshot.json` - Last sync state
- `.continuity/protected-files.json` - Protected file patterns
- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` - Full context for AI handoff


## Project Purpose
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as: - [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing). - [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container). - Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.

## Session Checklist

- [x] Read SESSION_HANDOFF.md
- [ ] Verify whether Continuity MCP tools are available in this client
- [ ] If MCP is unavailable, use repo instruction files, `.continuity/mcp-health.json`, and `.continuity/unfinished-task.json` as fallback context
- [ ] Search past decisions before proposing architectural changes
- [ ] Log architectural decisions (only structural/behavioral/directional changes)
- [ ] Inform user when decisions are logged, recovered, or conflicts detected
- [ ] Recover any missed decisions before session ends
